# A Sandbox for Angular 1.5.x

This is a simple workshop for working with Angular. It is built using browserify and npm scripts.

Run `npm install` to build the project, then, `npm run dev` to start your development server.

There is a delay on the first build, refresh the browser and the app should appear.

Happy Developing!
